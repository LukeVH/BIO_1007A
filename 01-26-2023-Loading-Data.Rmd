### Create and save a dataset:
### write.table(x=varName, file="outputfileName.csv, header=T sep=",")


#### These functions read in a data set
### read.table() 
## read.table(file="path/to/data.csv", header = TRUE, sep = ",")

### read.csv(file="data.csv", header=T)


#### Use RDS object when only working in R. Creates an R object, so you don't have to work with individual files. Helps with data storage and transfering large files. Helpful with large data sets
## saveRDS(my_data, file="FileName.RDS")
## readRDS("FileName.RDS")
## p <- readRDS("FileName.RDS")


### Long vs Wide data formats
### wide format = contains values that do NOT repeat in the ID column
### long format = contains values that repeat in the ID column

library(tidyverse)
glimpse(billboard)

b1 <- billboard %>%
  pivot_longer(
    cols = starts_with("wk"), #specify which columns you want to make 'longer'
    names_to = "Week", # name of new column which will contain header names
    values_to = "Rank", #name of new column which will contain the values
    values_drop_na=TRUE #removes any rows where the value = NA
  )

#View(b1) ## rmarkdown does NOT like this - remove if knitting

### pivot_wider
### best for making occupancy matrix
glimpse(fish_encounters)
view(fish_encounters)

fish_encounters %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from= station, #which column you want to turn into multiple columns
              values_from = seen) #which column contains the values for new column cells
#creates occupancy matrix with NAs

fish_encounters %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from= station, #which column you want to turn into multiple columns
              values_from = seen, #which column contains the values for new column cells
              values_fill = 0) # fills NAs with 0s

#creates occupancy matrix with 0s instead of NAs

##### Dryad: makes research data freely reusable, citable, and discoverable
library(ggthemes)

## read.table()
dryadData <- read.table(file="Amphibian-Data/veysey powell and babbitt_data_buffers and amphibians2.csv", header=TRUE, sep=",")
glimpse(dryadData)
head(dryadData)

table(dryadData$species) ### allows you to see different groups of character column
summary(dryadData$mean.hydro)

dryadData$treatment
# glimpse(dryadData)
# head(dryadData)
# table(dryadData$species)

dryadData$species<-factor(dryadData$species, labels=c("Spotted Salamander", "Wood Frog")) #creating y 'labels' to use for the plot instead of AMMA and RASY

#class(dryadData$treatment)
dryadData$treatment <- factor(dryadData$treatment, 
                              levels=c("Reference",
                                       "100m", "30m")) #changes the order of the treatment groups to reference, 100m, 30m instead of 100m, 30m, reference


p<- ggplot(data=dryadData, #defines the data set that the plot will be made from
           aes(x=interaction(wetland, treatment), 
               y=count.total.adults, fill=factor(year))) + geom_bar(position="dodge", stat="identity", color="black") + # defines which columns and rows should be represented in the plot on the x and y axes. interaction groups treatment and wetland. fill groups and colors columns by year. geom_bar makes it a bar plot. position defines where the bars should be such as stacked or grouped. Stat is how the plot treats the data. color changes the color of the outlines.
  ylab("Number of breeding adults") + #gives the y axis title
  xlab("") + # gives the x axis title (nothing)
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = c(0,100,200,300,400,500)) + # labels the units of the y axis and makes them continuous on a defined range
  scale_x_discrete(labels=c("30 (Ref)", "124 (Ref)", "141 (Ref)", "25 (100m)","39 (100m)","55 (100m)","129 (100m)", "7 (30m)","19 (30m)","20 (30m)","59 (30m)")) + #labels the units for the x axis. Makes them discrete values
  facet_wrap(~species, nrow=2, strip.position="right") + # wraps the plots into a more easily viewed double plot. species names are placed on the right
  theme_few() + scale_fill_grey() + # makes the theme and makes it greyscale
  theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill = 'gray94', color = 'green'), legend.position="top",  legend.title= element_blank(), axis.title.y = element_text(size=12, face="bold", colour = "orange"), strip.text.y = element_text(size = 10, face="bold", colour = "red"))+  # changes the color and fill of the panel background's rectangle, locates the position of the legend, removes a legend title, defines the size, boldness, and color of the y axis label. strip.text.y changes the size, boldness, and color of the species name on the y axis on the right
  guides(fill=guide_legend(nrow=1,byrow=TRUE)) # makes the legends one row instead of two

##### Programming in R
##### January 12th 2023
##### LVH

## Advantages
# interactive use
# graphics, statistics
# very active community of contributors
# works on multiple platforms

## Disadvantages
# lazy evaluation
# som2 packages are poorly documented
# functions are hard to learn (steep learning curve)
# unreliable packages
# problems with big data (multiple GBs)

# Let's start with the basics

## Assignment operator: used to assign a new value to a variable

x <- 5
print(x)
x

y = 4
#legal but not used except in function arguments because it is confusing
y = y + 1.1
y <- y + 1.1

## Variables: used to store information (a container)

z <- 3 #single letter variables if not important
plantHeight <- 10 #camel case format
plant_height <- 3.3 #snake case format, a preferred method
plant.height <- 4.2 #don't use this because some functions use a period

. <- 5.5 #reserve for a temporary variable

## Functions: blocks of code that perform a task; use a short command over again instead of writing out that block of code multiple times

# you can create your own function!

square <- function(x = NULL){ 
  
  x <- x^2
  print(x)
  
  }

z<-102
square(x=z) #the argument name is x

### or there are built in functions
sum(109, 3, 10) ## look at package info using ?sum or going to Help panel

### Atomic Vectors
# one dimensional (a single row)
# data structures in R programming

### types
# character strings (usually within quotes)
# integers (whole numbers)
# double (real numbers, decimal)
# both integers and doubles are numeric in class
# logical (TRUE and FALSE)
# factors (categorizes, groups variable)

# c function (combine)
z <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 4.5, 4)
print(z) #prints
class(z) #returns the class, class is the general data type
typeof(z) #returns type of variable
is.numeric(z) #returns T/F

## c() always "flattens" to a vector
z <- c(c(3,4), c(5,6))

# character vectors
z <- c("perch", "bass", "trout")
print (z)
z <- c("this is only 'one' character string",'a second',"a third")
print(z)

typeof(z)
is.character(z) #is. functions tests whether its a certain data type

### Logical (Boolean), no quotes, all caps: TRUE and/or FALSE
z<-c(T, F, TRUE, FALSE) # as. functions coerces data type
z<-as.character(z)
is.logical(z)

# Type
# is.numeric / as.character
# typeof()

#length
length(z)
dim(z) # NULL because vectors are 1 dimension

## Names
z <- runif(5) #provide info about uniform distribution of an interval, gives random uniform distribution between 0-1, (give me 5 random numbers between 0-1)
names(z) <- c("chow", "pug", "beagle", "greyhound", "akita")
print(z)
names(z) #shows names now
names(z) <- NULL

##### NA values stand for missing data

z<-c(3.2, 3.5, NA)
typeof(z)
mean(z) #if any NAs, functions do not work

#check for NAs
anyNA(z)
is.na(z)
which(is.na(z)) #helpful for exploring data and determining where NAs are


## Subsetting vectors
# vectors are indexed
z <- c(3.1, 9.2, 1.3, 0.4, 7.5)
z[4] # use square brackets to subset by index
z[c(4,5)] #need to use c for multiple indices
z[-c(2,3)] #minus sign to exclude elements
z[-1]
z[z==7.5] #use double equals for exact match
z[z<7.5] #use logical statements within square brackets to subset by conditions

z[which(z < 7.5)] #which only outputs indices; within [] subsets those values 

# creating logical vector
z < 7.5

## subsetting characters (named elements)
names(z) <- c("a", "b", "c", "d", "e")
z[c("a", "d")]

# subset
subset(x=z, subset= z>1.5)


# randomly sample
# sample function
story_vec <- c("A", "Frog", "Jumped", "Here")

sample(story_vec) # randomly shuffles vector with no arguments

# randomly select 3 elements from vector
sample(story_vec, size = 3)

story_vec <- c(story_vec[1], "Green", story_vec[2:4])
story_vec[2] <- "Blue"
story_vec

# vector function
vec <- vector(mode = "numeric", length=5)


### rep and seq function
z <- rep(x=0, times=100)
z<- rep(x=1:4, each =3)

z<-seq(from=2, to=4)
z<-seq(from=2, to=4, by=0.5)

seq(from=1, to=length(z))


```
